  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:2912 - The LUT-1 inverter "disp/SEGCLR1_INV_0" failed to join the
   "OLOGICE2" comp matched to output buffer "SEGCLR_OBUF".  This may result in
   suboptimal timing.  The LUT-1 inverter disp/SEGCLR1_INV_0 drives multiple
   loads.
WARNING:Pack:2912 - The LUT-1 inverter "disp/SEGCLR1_INV_0" failed to join the
   "OLOGICE2" comp matched to output buffer "LED_CLR_OBUF".  This may result in
   suboptimal timing.  The LUT-1 inverter disp/SEGCLR1_INV_0 drives multiple
   loads.
WARNING:Place:1399 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <clr> is placed at site <AF13>. The corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <clr_IBUF_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y1>. The clock IO can
   use the fast path between the IOB and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed
   on a Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites in
   its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this
   problem exists and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <clr.PAD> allowing
   your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules
   related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  14 block(s) removed
  31 block(s) optimized away
  52 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
